    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Our project focuses on anomaly detection in the wood industry. Anomalies, such as defects or irregularities,
        in wood planks can have significant consequences, leading to reduced quality and increased costs.</p>
    <p>The goal of our project is to develop a machine learning-based solution that can automatically detect
        anomalies in wood planks, aiding in quality control processes.</p>
    <h3>About the Model</h3>
    <p>We have developed a deep learning model based on the VGG16 architecture, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
        The model has been fine-tuned using a custom dataset consisting of more than 5500 images of both good quality
        wood planks and anomalous planks.</p>
    <p>Our model has been trained to classify images into two categories: "good" and "anomaly", facilitating the
        identification of defective wood planks with high accuracy.</p>
    <p>For more details and access to the dataset used in training, you can visit our GitHub repository:
